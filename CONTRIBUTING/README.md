# Contribution Guidelines

Looking to contribute to this repository? Take a look at the open issues of each repository to find things that need some work :wink: All help is appreciated! :heart:



**Good to know:**

- To have an overview of who's working on what, take a look at this [kan-ban board][].

- Always pull in the latest code from `develop` before working on something.
  use your Git GUI for this or use `git pull origin develop` from the command line.
  
- Always work in a new branch with a distinct name. This provides a good overview for yourself and makes reverting changes a lot easier. If you're working on an issue, include the issue number as part of your the name of the branch. An example could be `feature/#22-dockerfile`, when you've been working on [issue #22 (Create Dockerfile)](https://github.com/waarzitjenu/server/issues/22).
  
- Know the difference between an **improvement** and an **enhancement**.
  
  - An **improvement** is something that **currently works** but could be done in a better way. Something that needs to be **improved**. An improvement does not change the overall behaviour of the application. Like [using gin-gonic/gin instead of net/http (#17)](https://github.com/waarzitjenu/server/pull/17).
  - An **enhancement** is something that doesn't yet exist, like a new feature. Something that needs to be added to the application in order to **enhance** it. An enhancement changes the behaviour of the application. Like [saving tracks to a database (#3)](https://github.com/waarzitjenu/server/issues/3).
  
- It could be possible that you need to work on multiple Go modules. You could do that by temporarily editing the `go.mod` file and add a `replace`.  This replaces the online dependency with a local one. For example:

  ```
  module github.com/waarzitjenu/server
  
  go 1.14
  
  require (
  	github.com/waarzitjenu/database v1.1.0
  )
  
  replace (
     github.com/waarzitjenu/database v1.1.0 => ../database
  )
  ```

  

- If you have any question, feel free to open an issue and give it the label `question`.
